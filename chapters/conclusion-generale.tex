%Roads face several problems in managing traffic, reducing pollution and helping to improve road safety. ITS issues in making roads smarter, more efficient and better managed. Prediction of road traffic speeds plays a crucial role in intelligent transport systems. Prediction helps to avoid traffic congestion over time, to achieve intelligent recall of traffic congestion.
%
%For accurate prediction of traffic speeds, we have proposed in this work a machine learning method called KnnLSTM-KF. This method, predicts the characteristics of traffic speeds over time. 
%
%In order to validate our work, we conducted experiments on four hybrid machine learning models: Simple KNN, KNN-KF, KNN-LSTM and KNN-LSTM-KF. Dataset of traffic flow of New York City in the United States was used for simulations. Comparative study shown that, the proposed KnnLSTM-KF model outperformed other hybrid models in terms of MAPE and MSE.

%This research can be improved as follows : 
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	
%	\item Taken into account other parameters such as road conditions and weather ;
%	
%	\item Used GPS positions (longitude and latitude) taken every five minutes on road links ;
%	
%	\item Extended these experiments to other types of vehicles.
